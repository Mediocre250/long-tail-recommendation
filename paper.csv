However, diversity has been rarely emphasized in the context of sequential recommendation. Sequential and diverse recommendation must learn temporal preference on diverse items as well as on general items. Thus, we propose a sequential and diverse recommendation model that predicts a ranked list containing general items and also diverse items without compromising significant accuracy.To learn temporal preference on diverse items as well as on general items, we cluster and relocate consumed long tail items to make a pseudo ground truth for diverse items and learn the preference on long tail using recurrent neural network, which enables us to directly learn a ranking function. Extensive online and offline experiments deployed on a commercial platform demonstrate that our models significantly increase diversity while preserving accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation model, and consequently our models improve user satisfaction.","2019-08","2021-09-12 00:42:43","2021-09-14 04:13:21","2021-09-12 00:42:43","2740-2746","","","","","","","","","","","International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization","Macao, China","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\MPJ8UIEF\Kim 等。 - 2019 - Sequential and Diverse Recommendation with Long Ta.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Twenty-Eighth International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence {IJCAI-19}","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing methods largely rely on either external knowledge or statistical bias information to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we tackle this issue from another two aspects: (1) scene-object interaction aiming at learning specific knowledge from a scene via an additive attention mechanism; and (2) long-tail knowledge transfer which tries to transfer the rich knowledge learned from the head into the tail. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset Visual Genome on three tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art competitors.

"F2738JU9","journalArticle","2020","Feldman, Vitaly; Zhang, Chiyuan","What Neural Networks Memorize and Why: Discovering the Long Tail via Influence Estimation","NeurIPS","","","","http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03703","Deep learning algorithms are well-known to have a propensity for fitting the training data very well and often fit even outliers and mislabeled data points. Such fitting requires memorization of training data labels, a phenomenon that has attracted significant research interest but has not been given a compelling explanation so far. A recent work of Feldman (2019) proposes a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon based on a combination of two insights. First, natural image and data distributions are (informally) known to be long-tailed, that is have a significant fraction of rare and atypical examples. Second, in a simple theoretical model such memorization is necessary for achieving close-to-optimal generalization error when the data distribution is long-tailed. However, no direct empirical evidence for this explanation or even an approach for obtaining such evidence were given. In this work we design experiments to test the key ideas in this theory. The experiments require estimation of the influence of each training example on the accuracy at each test example as well as memorization values of training examples. Estimating these quantities directly is computationally prohibitive but we show that closely-related subsampled influence and memorization values can be estimated much more efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of memorization for generalization on several standard benchmarks. They also provide quantitative and visually compelling evidence for the theory put forth in (Feldman, 2019).","2020-08-09","2021-09-12 07:35:32","2021-09-14 04:13:45","2021-09-12 07:35:32","","","","","","","What Neural Networks Memorize and Why","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2008.03703","","C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\K2UCBE54\Feldman 和 Zhang - 2020 - What Neural Networks Memorize and Why Discovering.pdf; C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\X4C4RJU2\2008.html; C:\Users\Administrator\Zotero\storage\I4Z9FEI5\Feldman 和 Zhang - 2020 - What Neural Networks Memorize and Why Discovering.pdf","","","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
